[Project 1: Predict if a loan default or not?](somayehY/LoanDefaultPrediction (github.com))


In this proect I built a model to predict default of a loan based on the data the applicant provided during application. This way the creditor can gauge how risky the loan is and they can make a better decision. 
The data is from Lending Club, the biggest peer to peer lending platform until 2020. During its operation, Lending Club would establish a platform for borrowers and investors where borrowers were allowed to create loan requests on its website. The data includes data of more than 2 million loans and 151 features.  
There were several challenges to make the model: there were missing data as well as outliers that I addressed. Furthermore, the data was imbalanced and I applied under_sampling to address the issue.
A simple version of the model is also deployed at http://192.168.0.15:8501


[Project 2: Credit Default Prediction](https://github.com/somayehY/CreditDefaultPrediction)


In this project, I created a model to predict if a credit card holder pays back his/her balance or they fail to do so.
About 22% of records were default, which means data was imbalanced and I used SMOTE to address the issue.
Gradient Boosting gives the best result and reached at 94% area under the curve.
There is no significant difference between men and women in paying back their balance.
People with higher credit limits perform better in paying back their balance
PAY_1, LIMIT_BAL and AGE are the most effective parameters.
If a credit holder fails to pay their last payment, chances are that they also will fail to pay their next one


[Project 3: Predict if a user of a taxi service will churn](https://github.com/somayehY/Time_Series_Ultimate_Challenge)


Data is of users who used a taxi service in the last six months. A user is considered a retained user if the had a trip within the previous 30 days. We are asked to
1.	Perform cleaning, exploratory analysis and visualize the data
2.	Build a predictive model to help Ultimate determine whether or not a user will be active
3.	Briefly discuss how Ultimate might leverage the insights gained from the model to

[Project 4: Environmental impacts of food](somayehY/Environmental-Impact--of-Food (github.com))


Agriculture is the most important contributor to the environmental changes and as the world’s population has increased, the demand for food, energy and water has increased. In this project, I looked at the environmental effects of several food items and effects of our diet on environment is studied. 3 diets are compared: Regular, Vegan and Vegie. For each diet, 3 meal plans are created and their environmental impacts are compared.
Four metrics are considered to make comparison between food items. These metrics are:
greenhouse gas emissions (kgs of CO2-equivalents): Greenhouse gases are mainly carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane, which are present as CO2 equivalent
Land use (m2)
freshwater withdrawals (liters)
eutrophying emissions (grams of PO4-equivalents): Eutrophying emissions represent runoff of excess nutrients into the surrounding environment and waterways, which pollute ecosystems.
Furthermore, I had a closer look at food supply chain, which consists of land usage, farm, animal feed, processing transport and retail and packaging to find out the most influentioal contributor to environmental contamination.


[Project 5: Children Book Recommendation System, Natural Language Processing](somayehY/Children-Book-Recommendation-system (github.com))

When, it comes to reading books, given the limited time a person has, it is crucial to invest on the right books. When the end user of a book is a toddler or a kid, choosing the right book with the right message to help his/her development becomes even more important. More importantly, sometimes the content of a book may convey a wrong message. In this project, I built a book recommendation system for children. The data used is from UCSD Book Graph (google.com). The data is scraped from Googlereads during 2017. It contains 1) meta-data of more than 120,000 children’s books and 2) more than 800,000 book reviews. 
What is eye opening in this book is the amount of hidden negative message, there may exists in some very popular children book.
