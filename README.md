# Project 1: Predict if a loan default or not?

In this proect I built a model to predict default of a loan based on the data the applicant provided during application. This way the creditor can gauge how risky the loan is and they can make a better decision. 
The data is from Lending Club, the biggest peer to peer lending platform until 2020. During its operation, Lending Club would establish a platform for borrowers and investors where borrowers were allowed to create loan requests on its website. The data includes data of more than 2 million loans and 151 features.  
There were several challenges to make the model: there were missing data as well as outliers that I addressed. Furthermore, the data was imbalanced and I applied under_sampling to address the issue.
A simple version of the model is also deployed at http://192.168.0.15:8501
