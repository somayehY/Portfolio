# Project 1, Predictive model: Predict if a loan default or not?

In this proect I built a model to predict default of a loan based on the data the applicant provided during application. This way the creditor can gauge how risky the loan is and they can make a better decision. 
The data is from Lending Club, the biggest peer to peer lending platform until 2020. During its operation, Lending Club would establish a platform for borrowers and investors where borrowers were allowed to create loan requests on its website. The data includes data of more than 2 million loans and 151 features.  
There were several challenges to make the model: there were missing data as well as outliers that I addressed. Furthermore, the data was imbalanced and I applied under_sampling to address the issue.
A simple version of the model is also deployed at http://192.168.0.15:8501

# Project 2, Story telling: Environmental impacts of food 

Agriculture is the most important contributor to the environmental changes and as the worldâ€™s population has increased, the demand for food, energy and water has increased. In this project, I looked at the environmental effects of several food items. 
In the first part of the project, environmental impacts of production of common food items are presented. Four metrics are considered to make comparison between food items. These metrics are:
greenhouse gas emissions (kgs of CO2-equivalents): Greenhouse gases are mainly carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane, which are present as CO2 equivalent
Land use (m2)
freshwater withdrawals (liters)
eutrophying emissions (grams of PO4-equivalents): Eutrophying emissions represent runoff of excess nutrients into the surrounding environment and waterways, which pollute ecosystems.
Furthermore, I had a closer look at food supply chain, which consists of land usage, farm, animal feed, processing transport and retail and packaging to find out the most influentioal contributor to environmental contamination.
In the second section effects of our diet on environment is studied. 3 diets are compared: Regular, Vegan and Vegie. For each diet, 3 meal plans are created and their environmental impacts are compared.
